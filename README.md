🎬 Welcome to our PyMovie project! 🍿

This project utilizes PyMovie to play MP4 files. While you have the option to convert your MP4 files to WAV, we've designed this specifically for MP4 playback to suit our robot's needs. 🤖

Customization is key! You can personalize your experience by adding your MP4 files to the 'answers' folder. Simply update the directory in the provided if statement. Just to remind you, only MP4 files are supported for this project. If you require WAV files, just paste them here in ChatGPT, and I'll happily adapt the code for you! 🎥💻

Thank you for choosing PyMovie. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show! 🎉🎞️
